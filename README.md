# Problem Statement
X Education sells online courses to industry professionals and markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Although sales team of X Education gets a lot of leads through search engines and also from past refrerals, however its lead conversion rate is very poor which is around 30%.

### The company wants to Know.
- Company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’.

- Higher score would mean that the lead is hot and is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

- Conversion Rate = (probability of a person becoming a customer of X Education *100)%

- Lead Score = probability of a person becoming a customer of X Education *100
